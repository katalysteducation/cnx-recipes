  Book Page

  A Page is usually a section inside a chapter. It contains:

  - `[data-type='metadata']` The attribution information for this Page
  - `[data-type='document-title']` The title of the Page

/*
  Term

  A term which is used to make the Book Index. Terms used in a Glossary are defined in the Glossary, not here.

/*
  Note

  A note or "feature". This is usually separated visually from the rest of the
  content in a book with a border and a separate background color.

  Contains an optional title, and optionally an additional class to help style the note

/*
  Figure

  A `<figure>` is wrapped in a `<div data-type='figure'>` which contains:
  - optional `[data-type='title']`
  - `figure` element
    - `[data-type='media']` : a wrapper element which may disappear in the future
      - `img[src][alt]` : The image for the Figure

  TODO: Maybe this should use the `<picture>` element instead of the `[data-type='media']` element:
  http://html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/responsive/picture-element/

  # TODO

  - Decide on what the baked markup for a figure with a title and caption should look like.
    - Proposals have mentioned using `<figcaption>` most of the time.
    - Maybe what is in the Raw HTML is _good enough_?

  Markup: ./page.figure.xhtml-baked.html

  Style guide: page.figure
*/



/*
  Paragraph

  A Paragraph of text. Some of the common things it can contain are:

  - `[data-type='term']` : A term that is defined elsewhere (in the glossary)
  - `strong`
  - `em`
  - `[data-type='list']` : an inline list
    - `[data-type='item']` : an item in the list
  - `math` : MathML

  TODO: Move these into a separate "inline" section in the HTML guide

  Section

/*
  Exercise

  An exercise contains a problem, optional title, and optional solution(s).

  Exercises are usually numbered and contain a link to the solution if it exists.
  Typically, an exercise is collated at the end of chapter.

  Solutions are collated (at the end of section, end of chapter or end of book), they are numbered (the number is the same as the exercise they are associated to) and link back to their exercise.

/*
  Glossary

  This element is often referred to as Key Terms in the textbook.
  It is collated as a separate Page at the end of a Chapter or a Book.
  Also, it is collected from individual glossary elements in each raw Page.

  Markup: ./book.glossary.xhtml-baked.html

  Book Index

/*
  Table

  The `table` element may contain a `caption`, `tbody`, `col`, and other _usual_ elements.

  If the table contains a title, there is an additional element inside `<caption>`

  # TODO

  - Decide on what the baked markup for a table with a title and caption should look like.
    - Proposals have mentioned wrapping the `<table>` element with a `.os-table-container` element.
    - Maybe what is in the Raw HTML is _good enough_?

  Markup: ./page.table.xhtml-baked.html

  Style guide: page.table
*/

/*
  Composite Page

  These are end-of-book or end-of-chapter Pages.

  A Composite Page is one that is automatically generated by moving/copying content from the raw pages.
  Examples include the end-of-chapter exercises, end-of-book solutions, end-of-chapter glossary, index.

  They:

  - must use data-type="composite-page".
  - must have a unique identifier (class) for styling purposes.
  - usually contain content separated by section(pages) or by chapter.
  - now appear in the TOC (currently not the case in the PDF).
  - aren't numbered in the content and in the TOC (the chapters and sections are)
  - follow the same rules as a regular data-type="page" (header hierarchy, metadata, etc.)

  Style guide: book.2-composite
*/


/*
  Book Preface

  A Preface is a Page at the beginning of a book that is not inside a Chapter. It contains:

  - `.preface` A class to identify it as a Preface
  - `[data-type='metadata']` The attribution information for this Page

/*
  Unnumbered Content

  Content that has been marked with the class `.unnumbered` by the content team.

  Currently, the recipe supports only tables and figures but
  this may apply to a note, a table, an equation, a figure.

  Markup: ./page.unnumbered.xhtml-baked.html

  Style guide: page.unnumbered

/*
  Lists

  Lists can contain a label or title and can be block content or inline.

/*
  Iframe

  An iframe can show an embedded simulation or video. Some formats cannot or would
  rather not show the iframe and present a link instead.

  So we wrap the element inside a `[data-type="alternatives"]` element and add
  enough classes to be able to select which alternative to show and which to hide.

  Markup: ./page.iframe.xhtml-baked.html

  Style guide: page.iframe

/*
  Links

  Links to simulations should open in a new tab (ie `<a target="_blank">`)
